<h1>Welcome to the test-bot-coinbase repository!</h1>
<p>This repository contains a python testbot that can be used on the pro.coinbase sandbox environment.</p>

<p><strong>This bot is a machine learning bot, but still is under development and is not working yet. Please do not use on live mode.
I am looking for people to work on this to make it work better.</strong></p>

<p>To use this testbot, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have Python 3 installed, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:</p>
